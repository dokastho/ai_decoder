- caesar cipher decryptor using frequency of letters
- for each encrypted word, there is a new key. this algorithm will find likely words using a training dataset
- training dataset consists of two things. lots of normal text, for frequency of words following other words
- this then finds words in encrypted ones and guesses which ones are correct
- neural net will score the decoded message for accuracy
- each generation will randomly select the first or second best guess, and the most accurate ones
- how can I use a neural net on non training datasets?
